The Purpose of this project is to provide an open source solution for controlling The Biomechatronics Lab's new version of robotic exoskeltons.

## Technical Solutions

BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is the heart of this project which provides a connection from this API to the exoskeletons. Bleak, a python library is used to handle all BLE operations. To find out more about Bleak click [here](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
